Raspberryproduce is a test store for RPI Zero based physics toys & learning steps from prototype to production. Test site is based on best bang for the buck analog educational circuit--open gate FET, & RPI Zero version thereof. Sensor extension is via pluggable I2C sensor & ADC Hat. Visualization extensions via fats in pinouts.xyz. Electronics concepts via Carver Mead CED.

RPI Zero Demon hunting kits
Elecricity is everywhere & is creepy as hell--demon-straightion charge conservation in the style of Carver Mims.
   CED not fluid analogy of charge, etc.

* Kit 1: 3x 1/4 size breadboard, jumpers, 5x LED, 5x FET
* Kit 2: Iron, solder, flux, brass, 10x FET, 10x LED, 5x proto boards
* Kit 3: Battery charger & solar cell
* Kit 4: A2D Hat & Pimoroni Phat Stack
* Kit 5: High power wifi enabled flashlight kit--dims light when demon present. Software tuned for broad & creepy dynamic range.
* Kit 6: Visual options field modulated
* Kit 7: Audio Synth options field modulated
* Kit 8: Young indstrualist kit--Kicad to PCB

# Prototyping Kits from Analog to Electroscope Hat
Cuban Flatbread portable prototyping workstation.<br />
Shared GPIO bus for Hats utilizing a Pimoroni backplane in combination with the Sparkfun breakouts with 1mm pitch, 4-pin JST connector as the last Hat on the bus. <br />

The design is intended to save time prototyping gizmos as well as larger systems in the same dev-env, to include all required system functionality & power, while minimzing custom work & maintaining a mobile environment. <br />

Extend [pinout.xyz](pinout.xyz) to all known hats & add links to store.<br />
