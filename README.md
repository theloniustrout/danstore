# RaspberryProduce


<br><br>
Is a store for gathering the best RPI Zero tools for the production of village infrastructure & cottage industry tools for  control & automation of: information, fluid & mechanical work & storage on the respective platforms: Linux/Python, [Cyclone](http://cyclone-power.com) steam power & fluid energy storage & conversion, [VESC](http://vesc-project.com) electrical power conversion.

The unifying concept for the store is a new class of PC, codenamed pbox. The PC is itself a prototyping environment that through subtraction evolves to the prototype & production tool. 

Backplane is shared GPIO for Hats utilizing Pimoroni backplane & I2C devices with two sizes of JST plugs for Sparkfun & Adafruit. Open, portable, low profile. Nothing new or fancy; just an entropy reducer to simplify the process & a collection of th best stuff in one place.

Intended as general purpose toolkit for new class of cost & energy efficient industrial applications such as refrigeration, electric transport, power generation & storage.

While the focus is industrial, the prices, openness, architecture, applicability, & efficiency are optimal & best of class. The assumption being that price is the barrier to entry for light industrial development of village centers & cottage industry. Industrial quality brushless drives, e.g. are thousands of dolllars, but are now availble for the cost of the PCB & BOM.

Economically, the intention is to catalyze distributed ownership of manufacturing to compete with centralized displacement of workers via AI,robotics, & end-user consumption of leased product marketing.

All products are scalable from single family to village-sized or larger & designed to be be competitive with the best-of-class industrial solutions.
