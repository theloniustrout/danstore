Raspberryproduce is a store for curating & distributing the best RPI Zero tools with a focus on the design, development, & production of village infrastructure. 

Specifically, the tool kits are dev tools for control & automation of: information, fluid & mechanical work & storage on the respective platforms: Linux/Python & [VESC](http://vesc-project.com) electrical power conversion.

Energy generation is TBD. Possibilities include:<br />
Ebay 30kw Capstone @ $100/kw; 25% electrical, 85% CHP; high power density<br />
Solar<br />
Low head hydro<br />
[Cyclone](http://cyclone-power.com) steam engines when they have something in production<br />

The unifying concept for the store is a new class of PC, code name--Cuban Flatbread. This PC is designed to be a flexibile prototyping environment for power & mechanical systems. 

The configuration reduces to the prototype & production tools as the prototype evolves, without significant changes to the dev-env. 

The enabling concept is the utilization of shared GPIO for Hats utilizing a Pimoroni backplane in combination with the Sparkfun I2C ecology with standardized JST 1mm plugs. The mashup brings the functionality beyond the level of gizmos & into more useful systems while minimzing custom work. 

Low profile, highly integrated, with minimal need for breadboarding, simplifies the initial development while consolidating the system for manageable & portable workspaces.

80% of all energy used on the planet goes to spinning electrical motors inefficiently. Developing nations are bringing more online exponentially with a bias toward inexpensive systems. Therefore potentially 5% or more overall gains are possible by lowering the price barrier to high performance energy utilization inherent in open systems designs. The initial reference design will focus on support systems for the VESC electric motor driver & power conversion software. A 50V 100A reference design is popular with the skate community, & a 75V 200A reference design is has been modeled in Spice.

The development concept is not unlike the [Two Cowboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDHqzUz39mU) dark fiber infrasture in Old's Canada. 
 

The working assumption is that the barrier to adoption to the most useful technology are the complexities & scrapping of middle-man attached to commodity systems. Highly refined industrial control & software commutation is now available in mass production, up to 10's of kw power density. Therefore, getting the best systems into builders hands brings the heart of mechanical industrial processes to small groups of individuals without requiring fiat banking capitalization.

Increasing the distribution of ownership of manufacturing & energy production can compete effectively with centralized entities enganged in displacement of salaried labor via AI, robotics, & surveillance. The reference system provides a viable alternative for those interested in devloping these concepts in their communities.


All products are scalable from single family to village-sized or larger & are intended to outperform modern western industry standards.

IGBT design based off a Silicon Carbide reference. The wide-bandgap materials are good for power densities in excess of a megawatt for a small system.
