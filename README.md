Raspberryproduce.com is to test Dan's marketing chops cuz not gf's site. RPI Zero based physics toys & learning how to make an RPI Hat from prototype to production might be the eventual products of this store that doesn't yet exist. 

Test product is based on best of bang-for-buck analog maximally educational circuit--freespace gate FET with the addition of Joule thief jiggles. But there's more! An RPI Zero version thereof. Sensor extension is via pluggable I2C sensor & ADC Hat. Visualization extensions via hats in [pinouts.xyc](http://pinouts.xyz) Charge conservation remixed by Jerry in the style of Carver Mim's modern interpretation of Bill Beaty's original paper.

Everyone loves Demon hunting kits. Now on RPI Zero!

# Analog baby!

Elecricity is everywhere & it is creepy AF.
   

* Kit 0: 3x 1/4 size breadboard, jumpers, 5x LED, 5x FET
* Kit 1: Iron, solder, flux, brass, 10x FET, 10x LED, 5x proto boards
* Kit 2: Joule Thief circuit
* Kit 3: Battery charger, solar cell

# Bring on the Power!

ðŸ†•ðŸ†•ðŸ†•ðŸ†• Internet of supernatural things!

Cuban Flatbread portable prototyping workstation.Shared GPIO bus for Hats utilizing a Pimoroni backplane in combination with the Sparkfun breakouts with 1mm pitch, 4-pin JST connector as the last Hat on the bus. <br />

The design is intended to save time prototyping gizmos as well as larger systems in the same dev-env, to include all required system functionality & power, while minimzing custom work & maintaining a mobile environment. <br />

Extend [pinout.xyz](pinout.xyz) to all known hats & add links to store.<br />



## Linux prototyping kits for Electroscope Hat

* Kit 4: A2D Hat & Pimoroni Phat Stack: bring in the signal & modulate stuff with charge differences!
* Kit 5: High power flashlight kit--light is snuffed when demon present. Software tuned for wide dynamic range. Scalable to 3 channel VESC 30kw, 2S20P BC Series High CRI High Power Density COB LED Daylight 5600K - BC270H  Each channel tuned to a different hidden dimension for the low low price of $20,000. Tap into your mom's Prius & trip out the neighbors.
* Kit 6: Audio Synth options field modulated
* Kit 7: Visual options field modulated
* Kit 8: Young indstrualist kit--Kicad to PCB
