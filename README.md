# RaspberryProduce



Is a store for the production of village infrastructure & cottage industry tools centered on Linux/Python control & automation of: ,information, electromagnetic, fluid, & mechanical work: [pbox automation, Cyclone fluid, VESC electrical power conversion ] tools.

The unifying product/concept for the store is a new class of PC, codename pbox. The PC is itself a prototyping environment that through subtraction evolves to the prototype & production tool. 

Backbone is shared GPIO for Hats utilizing Pimoroni backplane & I2C devices with two sizes of JST plugs for Sparkfun & Adafruit. Open, portable, low profile.  

Intended for new class of cost & energy efficient industrial applications such as refridgeration, electric transport, power generation & storage.

While the focus is industrial, the prices, openness, architecture, applicability, & efficiency are optimal & best of class. The assumption being that price, not education is the current barrier to entry for light industrial development of village centers & cottage industry.

Economically, the intention is to catalyze distributed ownership of manufacturing to compete with centralized displacement of workers via AI,robotics, & end-user consumption of leased product marketing.

All products are scalable from single family to village-sized or larger & designed to be be competitive with the best-of-class industrial solutions.
