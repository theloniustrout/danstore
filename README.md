Raspberryproduce.com is to test Dan's marketing chops. RPI Zero based physics toys & learning how to make an RPI Hat from prototype to production might be the eventual products of this store that doesn't yet exist. 

Test product is based on best on the bang for the buck analog educational circuit--open gate FET with the additoin of a LC circuit for max efficiency. But there's more! An RPI Zero version thereof. Sensor extension is via pluggable I2C sensor & ADC Hat. Visualization extensions via hats in [pinouts.xyc](http://pinouts.xyz) Electronics concepts are Carver Mims modern interpretation of Bill Beaty's original paper.

Everyone loves Demon hunting kits. Now on RPI Zero!

# Analog baby!

Elecricity is everywhere & it is creepy as hell.
   

* Kit 0: 3x 1/4 size breadboard, jumpers, 5x LED, 5x FET
* Kit 1: Iron, solder, flux, brass, 10x FET, 10x LED, 5x proto boards
* Kit 2: Joule Thief circuit
* Kit 3: Battery charger, solar cell

# Bring on the Power!

Cuban Flatbread portable prototyping workstation.<br />
Shared GPIO bus for Hats utilizing a Pimoroni backplane in combination with the Sparkfun breakouts with 1mm pitch, 4-pin JST connector as the last Hat on the bus. <br />

The design is intended to save time prototyping gizmos as well as larger systems in the same dev-env, to include all required system functionality & power, while minimzing custom work & maintaining a mobile environment. <br />

Extend [pinout.xyz](pinout.xyz) to all known hats & add links to store.<br />



## Linux prototyping kits for Electroscope Hat

* Kit 4: A2D Hat & Pimoroni Phat Stack
* Kit 5: High power wifi enabled flashlight kit--dims light when demon present. Software tuned for wide dynamic range.
* Kit 6: Audio Synth options field modulated
* Kit 7: Visual options field modulated
* Kit 8: Young indstrualist kit--Kicad to PCB
