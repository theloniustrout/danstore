Raspberryproduce is a test store for RPI Zero based physics toys & learning steps from prototype to production. Test site is based on two popular items--open gate FET & Zero GPIO backplane. Sensor extension is via pluggable I2C sensor breakouts & DAC/ADC Hat. General functions via extension of pinouts.xyz. Electronics concepts via Carver Mead CED.

RPI Zero Demon hunting kit
Elecricity is everywhere & is creepy as hell--demon-straightion charge conservation in the style of Carver Mims.
   CED not fluid analogy of charge, etc.

* Basic analog kit
* USB [charged](https://github.com/NeonHorizon/lipopi), [powerboost500](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1944)solar powered kit
* Combine with Hats via GPIO bus for custom displays & analog synth action.
* High power wifi enabled flashlight kit--dims light when demon present. Software tuned for broad & creepy dynamic range.

# Prototyping Kits from Analog to Electroscope Hat
Cuban Flatbread portable prototyping workstation.<br />
Shared GPIO bus for Hats utilizing a Pimoroni backplane in combination with the Sparkfun breakouts with 1mm pitch, 4-pin JST connector as the last Hat on the bus. <br />

The design is intended to save time prototyping gizmos as well as larger systems in the same dev-env, to include all required system functionality & power, while minimzing custom work & maintaining a mobile environment. <br />

Extend [pinout.xyz](pinout.xyz) to all known hats & add links to store.<br />

Check again pin collions: [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz/phatstack)
### Stage IV 
Add audio synth from electroscope input.
### Stage V 
Solder electrocope to protohat
## Stage VI
Bring protohat circuit into Kicad
## Stage VII
Send Gerbers to PCB for production<br />
Concept consolidation: rpi electroscope--from physics to production.
<br><br>
## Status
Research RPI electroscope
<br><br>

## Next Steps
Source parts. Have: Zero, FET, cap, 1Mohm, breadboard, protoboard, surface mount short header, li-bat.<br />
Don't have: Bat charger circuit, phat stack, solder.

Test electroscope.<br />
Write instructions for bringing to breadboard on-hand.<br />
Write instructions for moving to protoboard on-hand.<br />
Write instruction along the way.<br />
Source solar charge circuit.<br />
Determine minimum battery size.<br />
Sourcing, assembly, testing of Cuban Flatbread<br />
